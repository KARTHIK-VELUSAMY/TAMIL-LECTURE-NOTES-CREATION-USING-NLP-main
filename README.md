# ABSTRACT
Speech Recognition Technology is one from the fast growing engineering technologies. A real time speech to text conversion system converts the words into text type precisely within the similar approach that the user pronounces. Speech-to text conversion could be useful for people with hearing oral impairments in communication settings, e.g conferences. However, the transfer of speech into written language in real time needs special techniques as it should be very fast and correct to be understandable. System comprises of two segments, first segment is for processing acoustic signal which is caught by a microphone and the second segment is to process the signal,then mapping the signal to words. This project converts the given audio file into specified tamil language mentioned in the source code and the text document is created. This project provides an overview of major technological perspective and appreciation of basic progress of speech to text conversion.
